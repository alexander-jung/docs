Because CockroachDB is designed with high fault tolerance, backups are primarily needed for [disaster recovery]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/disaster-recovery-planning.md %}). However, taking regular backups of your data is an operational best practice. Before beginning a major-version upgrade, **we recommend [taking a backup]({% link {{ page.version.version }}/backup-and-restore-overview.md %}) of your cluster**. Depending on your requirements, you may choose to also back up your cluster before upgrading from one patch to another.
