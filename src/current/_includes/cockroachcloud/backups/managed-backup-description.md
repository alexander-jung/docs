[_Managed backups_]({% link cockroachcloud/backup-and-restore-overview.md %}) are automated backups of CockroachDB Cloud clusters that are stored by Cockroach Labs in cloud storage. By default, Cockroach Labs takes and retains managed backups in {{ site.data.products.basic }}, {{ site.data.products.standard }}, and {{ site.data.products.advanced }} clusters. Depending on the tier of your cluster, you can adjust the default settings of managed backups to meet your organization's disaster recovery requirements.
